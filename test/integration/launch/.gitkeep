# Integration test launch files go here
# 
# Each launch test file should:
#   1. Launch the nodes under test
#   2. Define test cases that assert on the ROS graph
#   3. Clean up nodes after test completion
#
# Example structure for a launch test:
#   test_<name>.launch.py
#
# See: https://github.com/ros2/launch/tree/rolling/launch_testing
