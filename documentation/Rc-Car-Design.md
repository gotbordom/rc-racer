  - Pinion Gear:
    - Name: Unknown
    - Teeth: 22
  - Spur Gear:
    - Name: Unknown
    - Teeth: 76
  - Transmission Gear:
    - Name: Traxxas Slash's Magnum 272
    - Gear Ratio: 2.72

    - Combined into transmission ratio at this time. 
  - Final Drive Ratio: (Spur Teeth / Pinion Teeth) * Internal Gear Ratio * Differential Gear Ratio = 3.45 * 2.72 = 9.384:1

    - Width: 28.5mm (1.1in)
    - NOTE: Dimensions are expected to change, this param should be adjustable as needed. Tires get smaller after use :smirk:
  - Insert: Foam
- Motor Encoder:
  - Name: Digikey - H2-0128-0000-05-A-Y-U-F-B-X
  - Type: magnetic
  - Style: Incremental
  - Pulses per Revolution: 128
  - NOTE: I am choosing this one for a few reasons:
    - I want the pulses to be low so I reduce inturrupt triggers handling ticks.
    - However I need enough resolution to ensure that the movement PER pulse is sufficiently small to allow myself to reduce a rotational transform from a series of cos / sin equations to a series of simple multiplcation equations using the rule of small angles. There are some steps to this
      - For starters lets assume the steering column can effectively turn 90 :degree: ( it likely can't but this is worst case anyway )
      - The RC car wheelbase is: 384mm
      - The min turning radius then would be: 384mm / sin(90) = 384mm.
      - To allow for the rule of small angles, we need :theta: << 1 radian.
      - The angular displacement ( in radian ) for a single pulse is: Linear Displaement / Turning Radius, with the gearing, wheel diameter, etc. and the absolute smallest turning radius for this RC car being 384mm, then our angular displacement = 0.1764 mm / 384mm = 0.000459 radians.
      - Since any turn angle between +/- 0-90 :degree: ( assuming 0 :degree: is forward ) will create a larger turning radius, this means that 0.000459 is the largest angular displacement we should see. So we should be safe to assume that PER pulse we can use the small angle assumption. Even then one wheel rotation ( 0.000459 * 128) would still be small enough to allow for the assumption to hold as well.
      - So with 128 pulses, and this frame, gearing and wheel setup, all turning angles should be small enough, to allow for small angle assumption. Just thinking ahead to make math easier/ faster.
- Motor Driver
  - Name: PCA9686 
  - Link: https://www.adafruit.com/product/815
  - Drawing: TBD
  - Using: Nvidia Jetson Nano PINS 1,3,5,6
      - Also known as 3.3 DC Volt, Ground and I2C Bus 1 (SDA/SCL)
- IMU
  - Name: BNO085 
  - Link: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4754
  - Drawing: TBD
  - Using: Nvidia Jetson Nano PINS 17,20,27,28
      - Also known as 3.3 DC Volt, Ground and I2C Bus 0 (SDA/SCL)
  - NOTES:
    - Known compatability issues: 
      The BNO08x I2C implementation violates the I2C protocol in some circumstances. This causes it not to work well with certain chip families. It does not work well with Espressif ESP32, ESP32-S3, and NXP i.MX RT1011, and it does not work well with I2C multiplexers. Operation with SAMD51, RP2040, STM32F4, and nRF52840 is more reliable.
